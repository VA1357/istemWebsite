                    In these unprecedented times, as the pandemic lockdown is well underway, humans are adapting at a rapid pace to the changes around them. However, in the digital age, humans will quickly have to adapt to the physical stress placed on their bodies as a result of interactions with technology. Due to the pandemic, the majority of the public now finds itself seated at desks for hours on end, often very stressed. This causes a lack of focus on a very key component: <u>Posture</u>. Humans are increasingly realizing that years of bad postures and habits are wreaking havoc on their bodies. This issue is not only a major one due to its severity in harming the greater population, it is often unnoticed until too late, and as such creates long term health issues that may not be simple to recover from as commonly conceived. Sitting in particular, must be done in a perfect manner, as otherwise , leaning and slouching can cause havoc to your spine, shoulders, neck and lower and upper back. The problem is in fact so common, that a new branch of Assistive Technologies are being explored for posture correction.

                    Assistive Technology(AT) is any device, software, or equipment that helps people work around challenges so they can learn, communicate, and function better. This is the true goal of my project. In recognizing not only the effect of this problem on my own life, but also by seeing the widespread danger it poses, it is necessary to conduct further research and fund programs that can further the field in order to create a long term solution to human posture due to the advent of technology. Not only is this wholly achievable due to the very technology humans now have access to, but is also very cost effective if implemented correctly.

            I plan to use AlwaysAI, and TensorFlow, which are machine learning platforms, in order to create a program that can use any webcam and analyze seated posture by mapping points. This functionality will be expanded to be able to view different types of posture, and provide detailed analysis on posture issues(with accuracy intervals) and a possibility to create trends in user data to create a long term recovery plan. In analyzing human facial features in order to diagnose posture there are some errors as compared to more formal analysis of standing human posture. However, my recent research on the Stomatognathic system provides a prospect on utilizing the jaw line as a way to analyze spinal posture, which will help improve the efficiency of my program.
